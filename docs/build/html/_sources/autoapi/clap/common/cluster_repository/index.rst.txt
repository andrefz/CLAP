Module Contents
---------------


.. py:class:: PlatformControlInfo(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`clap.common.repository.AbstractEntry`

   This class holds control information used to create nodes and cluster in the repository (database).
   It holds an incremental index to be used when creating such elements.


.. py:class:: ClusterInfo(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`clap.common.repository.AbstractEntry`

   This class holds information about a cluster that is stored in the repository and used by several interfaces
   Each cluster is unique and is composed by the following elements:
       * cluster_id: The unique identification of the cluster, used to perform operations across modules and instance interfaces
       * cluster_name: The name of the cluster used by the driver object that controls this cluster
       * cloud: The cluster (or cloud) provider that this cluster is attached (e.g., aws, azure, ...)
       * keypair: The name of the keypair used to connect to the machines created in this cluster
       * region: The avaliability zone that this cluster was created
       * template: Name of the template that was used to create this cluster
       * driver_id: ID of the driver that controls this cluster
       * driver_version: Version of the driver used by this cluster
       * tags: Additional user tags for cluster identification

   .. method:: __repr__(self)




.. py:class:: NodeInfo(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`clap.common.repository.AbstractEntry`

   This class holds information about a node that is stored in the repository and used by several interfaces
   Each node is unique and is composed by the following elements:
       * node_id: The unique identification of the node, used to perform operations across modules and instance interfaces
       * node_name: The name of the node used by the driver object that controls it
       * cluster_id: ID of the cluster that this node is attached to
       * flavor: Instance flavor (e.g., t2.micro in aws)
       * status: Last known status of the node (see PlatformCodes)
       * ip: IP address used to connect to this node (address used to perform SSH)
       * driver_id: ID of the driver that controls this node
       * driver_version: Version of the driver used by this node
       * keypair: The name of the keypair used to connect to the machines created in the node cluster
       * key: The private key file used to perform SSH and connect to machines
       * tags: Additional user tags for node identification
